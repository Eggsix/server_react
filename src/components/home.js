								<p>While we are building this community hub, we’ll be going live with PrestigePay Visa® Prepaid Debit cards on August 1st, 2016. These cards can be topped up and used at stores, online and at ATMs. They will allow us to test features with real users like you and work on building our BushMoney community.</p>
								<p>Most small rural and marginalized communities have few jobs and few opportunities, BushMoney will help these communities to build commerce and trade with each other, from farmers in the Matanuska Valley to Ivory carvers in the native villages, let's build Alaska economy from the ground up, buy local, eat local, trade local!</p>
